## Welcome!

First of all, welcome to the first Women Techmakers Berlin - Generative AI Course! This is going to be a challenging but exciting journey to getting started in the Generative AI world.

This guide covers all the steps needed to prepare for the workshops. Please ensure you have all the tools installed and ready to go before starting the course.

> You might feel a bit overwhelmed sometimes, especially if it is the first time you are hearing about some of these tools and concepts. Please bear with us! :bear: Just try to get the main concept, and use the community to get help, sharing any doubts or problems you encounter during the process

## Syllabus

This is a course designed for the software engineer who knows how to work with third-party REST APIs—either on a mobile app, a backend app, or a frontend app. We will jump directly into working with the OpenAI GPT-4o family of APIs and cover several bases for building generative AI applications.

1. Introduction to generative AI and text models  
Gain a solid understanding of GenAI’s core concepts and applications in textual content generation. You’ll explore the technology’s current capabilities and its potential future impact on various industries. This module sets the stage for your deep exploration of advanced topics.

2. Multimodal AI: Working with audio and image generation  
Explore the intersection of audio, visual, and textual data in AI systems. You’ll learn to work with AI models that can understand and generate content across different modalities. This includes techniques for image analysis, audio processing, and creating AI systems that can translate between various forms of media.

3. Retrieval Augmented Generation and its applications  
Learn to create AI systems that combine vast knowledge bases with generative capabilities. You’ll develop AI models that provide more accurate, contextual, and informative responses by leveraging external data sources. This technique enhances AI’s ability to generate relevant and factual content.

4. Multi-agent systems and complex reasoning  
Understand the design and implementation of AI agent systems. You’ll learn about different types of AI agents, from simple task-completion agents to complex multi-agent systems. This module covers decision-making processes, learning mechanisms, and strategies for creating autonomous AI entities that adapt to various environments and tasks.

The course is divided into four workshops. To receive certification, you must attend all workshops and present a demo of your application at the end of the course.

Participants should bring their app ideas and work in their environment—we will do the code examples in JavaScript in Node.js, and you can translate them to whichever language you use to build your own apps. We will also provide a starter template for the backend repo.

## FAQ

**Q. Do I need to bring my laptop?**  
A. Yes, participants should bring their laptops with them to their preferred work environment.
 
**Q. Can I skip one workshop?**  
A. We do not recommend skipping the workshops. This is an intense course, and missing one will heavily impact your ability to complete your final project.  
You will not receive a certificate if you miss one of the workshops.

**Q. I'm a junior developer. Can I join this course?**  
A. The course is designed for software engineers who know how to work with third-party REST APIs—either on a mobile app, a backend app, or a frontend app. If you have the experience to keep up with that and focus your learning solely on AI, this course is definitely for you.

**Q. What do I need to receive my certificate?**  
To receive your certificate, you must attend all four workshops and present your final project.

**Q. When are the workshops?**  
A. The course runs every Monday in October from 18:30 to 21:30
- Monday 7 October from 18:30 to 21:30
